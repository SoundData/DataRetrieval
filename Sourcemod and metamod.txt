Base tools to help us program the plugin for TF2. Metamod is needed to run Sourcemod.
Using Sourcemod we will create the necessary plugins and extensions to transfer data
to our music algorithm.

1. Navigate: to /steam/steamcmd/tf2/tf
   Type: wget http://cdn.probablyaserver.com/sourcemod/mmsource-1.10.4-linux.tar.gz

2. Type: tar -xvf mmsource-1.10.4-linux.tar.gz
   (extracts metamod and creates addons folder in the tf2 folder)	

3. Navigate to /steam/steamcmd/tf2/tf/addons
   Type: wget http://sourcemod.gameconnect.net/files/sourcemod-1.7.0-linux.tar.gz

4. Type: tar -xvf sourcemod-1.7.0-linux.tar.gz
   (extracts sourcemod in the addons folder)

5. Directories of ~/steamcmd/tf2/tf/addons/sourcemod/plugins
              AND ~/steamcmd/tf2/tf/addons/sourcemod/extensions 
   are what we are going to be using a lot.
