3. Errors: Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/0' - please check.
   Explanation: this is because (you) initiated the current terminal - you probably
   did a sudo su into the user you are not trying to run screen as.
   
   Solution: Sign out and properly connect as the user you wish to use.
   OR 
   Run script /dev/null to own the shell. Try screen again.
