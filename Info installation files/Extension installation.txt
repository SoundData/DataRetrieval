1. User was promoted to sudo user and now able to install system files.

2. installed git using sudo apt-get install make

3. installed gcc using sudo apt-get install gcc and g++

4. cloned the git sourcemod repo into the steamcmd/tf2/tf/addons

5. cloned our MessageBroadcastExtension into the steamcmd/tf2/tf/addons/sourcemod/
public/sample_ext and then moved the files up replacing and merging.

6. sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386 //fixes one of the extension compilation errors
( i believe it was #include <sys/"something">

7. sudo apt-get install gcc-4.9-multilib g++-4.9-multilib //Fixes another error 
(This one was #include <bits/c++config.h>)

8.Solved:

extension.cpp: In function ‘cell_t TellClientAbout(SourcePawn::IPluginContext*, const cell_t*)’:
extension.cpp:64:60: error: ‘strnlen_s’ was not declared in this scope
  const size_t strSz = strnlen_s(eventInfo, MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE);


strlen subbed for the strnlen_s. strnlen_s is specific to microsoft systems, won't
compile on linux/OSX
